    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>French fries, also known as chips, are a popular and beloved side dish made from deep-fried or oven-baked slices of potatoes. They are a staple in many fast-food establishments and are enjoyed worldwide for their crispy exterior and fluffy interior. </p>
    <h3>Recipes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes (russet or Idaho potatoes are commonly used)</li>
        <li>Cooking oil (vegetable oil, peanut oil, or canola oil)</li>
        <li>Salt (for seasoning)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Peeling and Cutting:</h4>
        <ul><li>Potatoes are typically peeled, although some variations keep the skin for added texture and flavor.</li>
        <li>The potatoes are then cut into uniform, elongated pieces. The size can vary based on personal preference, ranging from thin shoestring fries to thicker steak fries.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Soaking (Optional):</h4>
        <ul><li>Some recipes recommend soaking the cut potatoes in cold water for about 30 minutes to remove excess starch. This step can contribute to a crispier texture.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Drying:</h4>
        <ul><li>After soaking (if done), the potato slices are thoroughly dried to prevent splattering when they are added to hot oil.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Frying:</h4>
        <ul><li>The potato slices are deep-fried in hot oil until they achieve a golden-brown color and a crispy texture. The oil temperature is usually maintained around 325-375°F (163-190°C).</li>
        <li>For a healthier alternative, some people opt to bake the fries in the oven, coating them with a small amount of oil.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Seasoning:</h4>
        <ul><li>Once fried or baked, the French fries are immediately seasoned with salt to enhance their flavor.</li></ul></li>
