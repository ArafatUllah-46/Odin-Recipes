    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Oven-baked pasta is a comforting and flavorful dish that involves baking pasta with various ingredients, typically including sauce, cheese, and other additions. This method allows the flavors to meld and intensify, and it results in a delicious, bubbly, and golden-brown dish.</p>
    <h3>Recipes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta (penne, rigatoni, ziti, or any preferred shape)</li>
        <li>Pasta sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>Cheese (mozzarella, Parmesan, ricotta, or a blend)</li>
        <li>Optional ingredients: Cooked and seasoned ground meat (beef, pork, or turkey), sautéed vegetables (bell peppers, onions, mushrooms), herbs (basil, oregano, parsley), and spices.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Cook the Pasta:</h4>
        <ul><li>Boil the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. It's important not to overcook it since it will continue to cook in the oven.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Prepare the Sauce:</h4>
        <ul><li>Heat the pasta sauce in a pan. You can use store-bought sauce or make your own by sautéing onions and garlic, adding crushed tomatoes, and seasoning with herbs and spices.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</h4>
        <ul><li>Drain the cooked pasta and mix it with the sauce in a large bowl. Ensure each pasta piece is coated evenly with the sauce.
        </li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Add Extras:</h4>
        <ul><li>If you're including additional ingredients like cooked meat, sautéed vegetables, or herbs, fold them into the pasta and sauce mixture.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Layering in a Baking Dish:</h4>
        <ul><li>Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature (usually around 375°F or 190°C).</li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta mixture to a baking dish, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>For added richness, dollop ricotta cheese on top or incorporate it into the layers.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Cheese Topping:</h4>
        <ul><li>Sprinkle a generous layer of shredded mozzarella (and Parmesan, if desired) over the top of the pasta, creating a cheesy crust.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Bake in the Oven:</h4>
        <ul><li>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the top is golden brown. This typically takes about 20-30 minutes.</li></ul></li>
        <li><h4>Serve Hot:</h4>
        <ul><li>Once done, let the oven-baked pasta rest for a few minutes before serving to allow it to set. Cut into portions and serve while it's still hot.</li></ul></li>
    </ol>
